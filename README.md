# Watermark Inserter
A Python script with an UI that allows you to insert your own watermark into your images

## Libraries used
### Flet
```bash
pip install flet
```

### Pillow
```bash
pip install pillow
```

## Installation
Run the `installation.bat` file to setup the script a faster way.

This file will create a virtual environment so it can install all the neccesary libraries for the script.

## How to use
In the `resources` folder, add your watermark image to use. Once that, copy the name of the file and its extension and write it just next to the `WATERMARK_ROUTE = "resources/"` 
line, this will allow the Script to find your watermark image. You can also copy the relative path of the file and just paste it.

After this, you can just run the `App.vbs` file and start using the Script.
